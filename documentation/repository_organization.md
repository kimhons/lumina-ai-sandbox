# Lumina AI Repository Organization and Version Control

This document outlines the repository structure, branching strategy, and version control workflow for the Lumina AI project.

## 1. Repository Structure

The Lumina AI project will be organized into multiple repositories to maintain separation of concerns and allow for independent development of different components:

```
lumina-ai (Organization)
├── lumina-core
│   ├── central-orchestration
│   ├── provider-layer
│   ├── computer-control
│   └── autonomous-execution
├── lumina-agents
│   ├── research-agent
│   ├── content-agent
│   ├── data-agent
│   └── code-agent
├── lumina-web
│   ├── web-ui
│   ├── api-gateway
│   └── shared-components
├── lumina-mobile
│   ├── mobile-ui
│   ├── shared-components
│   └── platform-adapters
├── lumina-tools
│   ├── web-tools
│   ├── data-tools
│   ├── document-tools
│   └── code-tools
├── lumina-platform
│   ├── windows-adapter
│   ├── macos-adapter
│   ├── linux-adapter
│   ├── android-adapter
│   └── ios-adapter
├── lumina-docs
│   ├── user-documentation
│   ├── developer-documentation
│   ├── api-documentation
│   └── architecture-documentation
└── lumina-deployment
    ├── infrastructure
    ├── ci-cd
    ├── monitoring
    └── security
```

## 2. Repository Setup

I'll use the provided GitHub token to set up these repositories under a new organization:

```bash
# Create GitHub organization (manual step through GitHub UI)
# Then use the token for authentication in subsequent commands

# Clone and set up each repository
for repo in lumina-core lumina-agents lumina-web lumina-mobile lumina-tools lumina-platform lumina-docs lumina-deployment; do
  # Create repository
  curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}" \
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
    https://api.github.com/orgs/lumina-ai/repos \
    -d "{\"name\":\"${repo}\",\"private\":true,\"description\":\"${repo} component of Lumina AI\"}"
  
  # Clone repository
  git clone https://github.com/lumina-ai/${repo}.git
  
  # Set up initial structure
  cd ${repo}
  mkdir -p src docs tests
  echo "# ${repo}" > README.md
  echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore
  echo "*.pyc" >> .gitignore
  echo "__pycache__/" >> .gitignore
  echo ".env" >> .gitignore
  
  # Initial commit
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial repository setup"
  git push -u origin main
  
  cd ..
done
```

## 3. Branching Strategy

We'll implement a Git Flow branching strategy with the following branches:

### 3.1 Main Branches

- **main**: Production-ready code, always stable
- **develop**: Integration branch for features, always contains the latest delivered development changes

### 3.2 Supporting Branches

- **feature/**: For developing new features
  - Branch from: develop
  - Merge back to: develop
  - Naming: feature/feature-name
- **release/**: For preparing releases
  - Branch from: develop
  - Merge back to: main and develop
  - Naming: release/version-number
- **hotfix/**: For urgent fixes to production
  - Branch from: main
  - Merge back to: main and develop
  - Naming: hotfix/issue-description
- **experimental/**: For experimental features
  - Branch from: develop
  - May or may not be merged back
  - Naming: experimental/feature-description

## 4. Version Control Workflow

### 4.1 Feature Development

```bash
# Start a new feature
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

# Work on the feature
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

# Push feature branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/new-feature-name

# When feature is complete, create pull request to develop branch
# After code review and approval, merge to develop
```

### 4.2 Release Process

```bash
# Create release branch
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b release/1.0.0

# Make release-specific changes
# ... version bumps, final fixes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare release 1.0.0"

# Push release branch
git push -u origin release/1.0.0

# After testing, merge to main
git checkout main
git pull
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
git push origin main --tags

# Also merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git pull
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
git push origin develop

# Delete release branch
git branch -d release/1.0.0
git push origin --delete release/1.0.0
```

### 4.3 Hotfix Process

```bash
# Create hotfix branch
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-fix

# Fix the issue
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Fix critical bug"

# Push hotfix branch
git push -u origin hotfix/critical-bug-fix

# After testing, merge to main
git checkout main
git pull
git merge --no-ff hotfix/critical-bug-fix
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Version 1.0.1"
git push origin main --tags

# Also merge to develop
git checkout develop
git pull
git merge --no-ff hotfix/critical-bug-fix
git push origin develop

# Delete hotfix branch
git branch -d hotfix/critical-bug-fix
git push origin --delete hotfix/critical-bug-fix
```

## 5. Continuous Integration and Deployment

We'll set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD with the following workflows:

### 5.1 CI Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Continuous Integration

on:
  push:
    branches: [ develop, feature/*, release/*, hotfix/* ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ develop, main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install pytest pytest-cov
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest --cov=./ --cov-report=xml
      - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### 5.2 CD Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/cd.yml
name: Continuous Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    tags: [ 'v*' ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install build twine
      - name: Build and publish
        env:
          TWINE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PYPI_USERNAME }}
          TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}
        run: |
          python -m build
          twine upload dist/*
```

## 6. Code Review Process

All code changes will go through a code review process:

1. Developer creates a pull request from their feature branch to develop
2. At least one other developer must review and approve the changes
3. Automated tests must pass
4. Code quality checks must pass
5. Once approved, the changes can be merged

## 7. Issue Tracking

We'll use GitHub Issues for tracking tasks, bugs, and feature requests:

### 7.1 Issue Templates

- Bug report template
- Feature request template
- Task template
- Documentation request template

### 7.2 Issue Labels

- Type: Bug, Feature, Task, Documentation
- Priority: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Status: To Do, In Progress, Review, Done
- Component: Core, Agents, Web, Mobile, etc.

## 8. Documentation

Each repository will include:

- README.md with overview and setup instructions
- CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
- docs/ directory with detailed documentation
- API documentation generated from code comments

## 9. Security Considerations

- The GitHub token will be stored securely and not committed to any repository
- Sensitive configuration will be stored in GitHub Secrets
- Regular security audits will be conducted
- Dependency scanning will be implemented to detect vulnerabilities

## 10. Version Control Best Practices

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Pull and rebase frequently to avoid merge conflicts
- Use meaningful branch names that reflect the work being done
- Don't commit generated files or dependencies
- Don't commit sensitive information (tokens, passwords, etc.)
- Review changes before committing

This repository organization and version control strategy will provide a solid foundation for the Lumina AI project, enabling efficient collaboration, quality control, and continuous delivery of new features and improvements.
