gemini_client = AsyncOpenAI(base_url="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/", api_key=gemini_api_key)

# Create agents with different LLM providers
claude_agent = Agent(
    name="Claude agent",
    instructions="You only respond to queries about code refactoring queries.",
    model=OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
        model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
