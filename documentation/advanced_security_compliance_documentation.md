Key features:
- Policy-based access control
- Hierarchical roles
- Dynamic permission evaluation
- Integration with identity providers

### Identity Management System

The Identity Management System handles user identities and authentication:

- **User Identity Lifecycle**: Manages the complete lifecycle from creation to deletion
