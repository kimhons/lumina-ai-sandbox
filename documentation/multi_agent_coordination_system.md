# Synergos AI: Multi-Agent Coordination System

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of the Multi-Agent Coordination System for Synergos AI. This system enables the specialized agents (Research, Content, Data, and Code) to work together seamlessly under the direction of the Central Orchestration Agent, creating a truly powerful agentic system capable of handling complex, multi-domain tasks.

## Coordination Architecture

### 1. Central Orchestration Layer

The Central Orchestration Agent serves as the primary coordinator with the following responsibilities:

- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex user requests into subtasks
- **Agent Selection**: Determining which specialized agents should handle each subtask
- **Workflow Management**: Creating and managing execution sequences
- **Result Integration**: Combining outputs from multiple agents into coherent responses
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolving contradictions or inconsistencies between agent outputs
- **Priority Management**: Handling task prioritization and resource allocation

### 2. Communication Protocol

A standardized communication protocol enables efficient interaction between agents:

**Message Types:**
- **Task Assignment**: Central Agent → Specialized Agent
- **Status Update**: Specialized Agent → Central Agent
- **Result Delivery**: Specialized Agent → Central Agent
- **Clarification Request**: Specialized Agent → Central Agent
- **Coordination Message**: Specialized Agent → Specialized Agent (via Central Agent)

**Message Structure:**
```json
{
  "message_id": "unique_identifier",
  "message_type": "task_assignment|status_update|result_delivery|clarification_request|coordination",
  "sender": "agent_identifier",
  "recipient": "agent_identifier",
  "content": {
    "task_id": "task_identifier",
    "priority": "high|medium|low",
    "payload": {},
    "metadata": {}
  },
  "timestamp": "ISO8601_timestamp"
}
```

### 3. Workflow Orchestration

The system implements sophisticated workflow management:

- **Sequential Workflows**: Tasks executed in a specific order
- **Parallel Workflows**: Multiple tasks executed simultaneously
- **Conditional Workflows**: Execution paths determined by intermediate results
- **Iterative Workflows**: Repeated execution until conditions are met
- **Hybrid Workflows**: Combinations of the above patterns

### 4. Shared Memory System

A robust shared memory architecture enables knowledge sharing between agents:

- **Short-term Working Memory**: For active task information
- **Long-term Knowledge Base**: For persistent information storage
- **Context Window**: For maintaining conversation and task history
- **Agent-specific Memory Partitions**: For specialized knowledge
- **Global Memory Access**: For system-wide information sharing
