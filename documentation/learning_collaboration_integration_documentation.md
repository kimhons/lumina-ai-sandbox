3. Learning context is created to share data and parameters
4. Learning tasks are distributed to team members
5. Federated learning is coordinated across the team
6. Results are aggregated and shared with all team members

### 2.3 Collaborative Problem Solving

Collaborative problem solving is implemented through the `ProblemSolvingService` which provides:

- **Problem analysis**: Determines if a problem is suitable for collaborative solving
- **Problem decomposition**: Breaks down complex problems into manageable subtasks
- **Team formation**: Creates teams with appropriate capabilities for the problem
- **Context creation**: Establishes shared contexts for problem-solving
- **Execution coordination**: Manages the execution of subtasks according to dependencies

Key classes:
- `ProblemSolvingSession`: Model class representing a problem-solving session
- `ProblemSolvingSessionRepository`: Repository for storing and retrieving problem-solving sessions
- `ProblemSolvingController`: REST API endpoints for problem-solving operations

Example problem-solving flow:
1. Problem is analyzed to determine collaborative suitability
2. Problem is decomposed into subtasks with dependencies
3. Team is formed with agents possessing the necessary capabilities
4. Problem-solving context is created to share problem data
5. Subtasks are executed according to dependency graph
6. Results are integrated into a final solution
7. Solution is verified against problem requirements
