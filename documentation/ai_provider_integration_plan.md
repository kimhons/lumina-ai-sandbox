# Synergos AI: AI Provider Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the approach for integrating multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini) into the Synergos AI system. Each provider offers unique strengths that will be leveraged for specific agent functions.

## AI Provider Selection Strategy

### OpenAI (GPT Models)
**Primary Use Cases:**
- Central Orchestration Agent (primary model)
- Code Agent (primary model)
- General task handling across all agents

**Strengths:**
- Strong reasoning capabilities
- Excellent code generation
- Broad knowledge base
- Robust tool use

**Models to Integrate:**
- GPT-4o for complex reasoning and orchestration
- GPT-3.5-Turbo for cost-efficient operations

### Anthropic Claude
**Primary Use Cases:**
- Content Agent (primary model)
- Research Agent (for nuanced analysis)
- Ethical reasoning tasks

**Strengths:**
- Exceptional writing quality
- Nuanced understanding of context
- Strong ethical reasoning
- Detailed explanations

**Models to Integrate:**
- Claude 3 Opus for highest quality content
- Claude 3 Sonnet for balanced performance

### Google Gemini
**Primary Use Cases:**
- Data Agent (primary model)
- Research Agent (for factual information)
- Multimodal tasks

**Strengths:**
- Strong mathematical capabilities
- Excellent factual recall
- Multimodal understanding
- Data analysis capabilities

**Models to Integrate:**
- Gemini Pro for general tasks
- Gemini Ultra for complex data analysis

## Integration Architecture

### API Key Management
1. Store API keys securely in DataStax Langflow's global variables
2. Create separate variables for each provider:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

### Model Selection Logic
Implement a model selection system that chooses the appropriate provider based on:
1. Task type and requirements
2. Performance characteristics needed
3. Cost considerations
4. Fallback options if primary provider is unavailable

### Implementation in Langflow

#### Central Orchestration Agent
```
1. Primary: OpenAI GPT-4o
2. Configure OpenAI API key connection
3. Add system prompt with instructions for model selection
4. Implement logic for routing to specialized agents
```

#### Research Agent
```
1. Primary: OpenAI GPT-4o
2. Secondary: Claude 3 Sonnet for nuanced analysis
3. Tertiary: Gemini Pro for factual information
4. Configure API key connections for all three providers
5. Implement switching logic based on research task type
```

#### Content Agent
```
1. Primary: Claude 3 Opus/Sonnet
2. Secondary: OpenAI GPT-4o
3. Configure API key connections for both providers
4. Implement style and tone controls specific to Claude
5. Add fallback to OpenAI if Claude is unavailable
```

#### Data Agent
```
1. Primary: Gemini Pro/Ultra
2. Secondary: OpenAI GPT-4o
3. Configure API key connections for both providers
4. Optimize for mathematical and analytical tasks
5. Add fallback to OpenAI if Gemini is unavailable
```

#### Code Agent
```
1. Primary: OpenAI GPT-4o
2. Secondary: Claude 3 Opus for complex reasoning
3. Configure API key connections for both providers
4. Optimize for code generation and debugging
5. Add language-specific optimizations
```

## Fallback Mechanisms

Implement robust fallback mechanisms to ensure system reliability:

1. **Primary Provider Unavailable:**
   - Automatically switch to secondary provider
   - Log the failure and reason
   - Notify the orchestration agent

2. **All Providers Unavailable:**
   - Implement graceful degradation
   - Provide user with appropriate error message
   - Cache request for later processing if possible

3. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Implement token usage tracking
   - Add queuing system for high-volume periods
   - Balance load across providers

## Cost Optimization

Implement strategies to optimize costs while maintaining quality:

1. **Tiered Model Selection:**
   - Use more powerful models only when necessary
   - Route simple queries to cost-effective models
   - Implement complexity analysis to determine appropriate model

2. **Caching:**
   - Cache common responses to reduce duplicate API calls
   - Implement response caching with appropriate TTL
   - Use vector similarity to identify similar previous queries

3. **Batching:**
   - Combine related requests where possible
   - Implement request batching for efficiency
   - Optimize token usage through prompt engineering

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up API Connections:**
   - Create accounts with all three providers
   - Generate API keys
   - Store keys in Langflow global variables

2. **Configure Model Selection:**
   - Implement selection logic in each agent
   - Create switching mechanisms based on task type
   - Set up fallback pathways

3. **Test Provider Integration:**
   - Verify connectivity with all providers
   - Test fallback mechanisms
   - Benchmark performance across different task types

4. **Optimize Prompts:**
   - Tailor prompts for each provider's strengths
   - Implement provider-specific instructions
   - Optimize token usage

5. **Monitor and Refine:**
   - Track performance metrics by provider
   - Analyze cost vs. performance
   - Continuously refine selection logic

## Technical Requirements

- DataStax Langflow account
- API keys for all three providers:
  - OpenAI API key
  - Anthropic API key
  - Google AI API key
- Monitoring system for tracking usage and performance
- Cost tracking mechanisms
