# Synergos AI: Implementation Plan for Research Agent

## Overview

The Research Agent is a specialized component of Synergos AI, focused on information gathering, fact-checking, and synthesis. This document outlines the implementation steps for creating the Research Agent in DataStax Langflow.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up Basic Canvas

1. Create a new flow in DataStax Langflow named "Synergos AI - Research Agent"
2. Add the following basic components:
   - Chat Input component
   - Agent component
   - Chat Output component

### 2. Configure OpenAI Integration

1. Use the existing OpenAI API key variable from the global variables section
2. Connect the OpenAI API key to the Agent component
3. Select GPT-4 as the base model for comprehensive research capabilities

### 3. Implement Memory System

1. Add the "Astra DB Chat Memory" component
2. Configure the memory component with appropriate session settings
3. Connect the memory component to the Agent
4. Toggle the "External Memory" option in the Agent's Controls section

### 4. Define System Prompt

Create a custom system prompt for the Research Agent:

```
You are the Research Agent of Synergos AI, a specialized component focused on information gathering and synthesis. Your role is to:

1. Search for and retrieve accurate, up-to-date information
2. Analyze and summarize content from multiple sources
3. Verify facts through cross-referencing and validation
4. Extract key insights and organize information logically
5. Generate comprehensive research reports

When conducting research:
- Prioritize authoritative and reliable sources
- Cross-check information across multiple sources
- Clearly distinguish between facts, opinions, and speculation
- Provide proper citations and references
- Organize information in a clear, structured manner

Your goal is to provide thorough, accurate, and well-organized information that helps users understand complex topics and make informed decisions.
```

### 5. Add Research Tools

1. Add the Search tool for web searches
2. Add the Browser tool for navigating web pages
3. Add the Document Reader tool for processing documents
4. Add the Summarization tool for condensing information
5. Connect all tools to the Agent component

### 6. Configure Communication Protocol

1. Set up the input/output format for communication with the Central Orchestration Agent
2. Implement logic for receiving research tasks
3. Configure response formatting for consistent output

### 7. Test Research Capabilities

1. Test the agent with simple research queries
2. Verify that the agent can search for information effectively
3. Test the agent's ability to synthesize information from multiple sources
4. Evaluate the quality and accuracy of research outputs

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. Enhance search capabilities with specialized APIs
2. Implement advanced fact-checking mechanisms
3. Add domain-specific research tools
4. Optimize information synthesis algorithms
5. Implement source credibility assessment

## Technical Requirements

- DataStax Langflow account
- OpenAI API key
- Astra DB for memory storage
