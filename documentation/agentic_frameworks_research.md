# Agentic Frameworks Research

## Overview of Agentic Frameworks

Based on our research, here are the key agentic frameworks that can be used to build systems similar to Manus AI:

### 1. LangGraph
- **Description**: Uses LLM applications to create an easy-to-use, graph-based approach for building agentic AI workflows
- **Key Features**:
  - Building applications that use LLMs for tasks like question answering, summarizing content, creating chatbots
  - Supports cyclical graphs and branching for dynamic control over agents
  - Provides built-in state persistence to improve traceability and debugging
  - Enables easy human oversight for approving complex workflows or rerouting agents

### 2. CrewAI
- **Description**: An open-source agentic framework that simplifies the orchestration of autonomous agents
- **Key Features**:
  - Creates specialized AI agent teams to maximize efficiency and minimize redundancies
  - Builds complex applications where LLMs work together, leveraging different specialized capabilities
  - Boasts an adaptive infrastructure that allows self-hosted or cloud-based deployments
  - Compatible with the LangChain ecosystem

### 3. Swarm (OpenAI)
- **Description**: An agentic framework developed by OpenAI with a minimalist design
- **Key Features**:
  - Lightweight design providing developers with high-level automation control
  - Can interpret easy-to-understand instructions using Natural Language Processing
  - Allows for building and testing individual agents in isolated environments before entering a larger swarm
  - Features two primary core functionalitiesâ€”agents and handoffs

### 4. ARCADE
- **Description**: A platform for developing and deploying multi-agent systems with a focus on reactive agents
- **Key Features**:
  - Offers a structured way to describe architecture with guidelines and a reference model
  - Supports documentation and customization for specific use cases
  - Adaptable to various software systems and technologies
  - Ideal for applications where agents need to react quickly to environmental changes

### 5. FIPA Standards
- **Description**: A standards organization that influences how agents are built, established in the 1990s
- **Key Features**:
  - Provides a structured format for AI agent communication (FIPA-ACL)
  - Offers standardized practices for managing agents throughout their lifecycle
  - Allows multiple agent types using different programming languages to function on the unified FIPA-OS framework
  - Widely recognized and used in many multi-agent systems

### 6. JADE Framework
- **Description**: Java Agent Development framework, a popular implementation of FIPA standards
- **Key Features**:
  - Ensures different agent systems can communicate seamlessly using FIPA's common language and protocols
  - Provides Java-based libraries and active forums for streamlined development
  - Uses an asynchronous message-passing model for smooth agent communication
  - Distributed under LGPL, allowing free use and modification

### 7. LLaMA
- **Description**: A foundational LLM model developed by Meta (not strictly an agentic framework)
- **Key Features**:
  - Provides access to a wide range of written languages for cross-lingual data retrieval
  - Compatible with LLaMA Stack, a large set of pre-configured tools and APIs
  - Allows for multiple model sizes to accommodate different resource constraints
  - Serves as a starting point for fine-tuning specific applications

## Choosing an Agentic Framework

When selecting an agentic framework for building a system similar to Manus AI, consider:

1. **Define business needs**: Identify unique requirements for your agentic system
2. **Outline specific objectives**: Build measurable goals to track performance
3. **Look for tools and support**: Consider whether the framework provides necessary tools and libraries
4. **Evaluate integration capabilities**: Assess how well the framework integrates with existing systems
5. **Consider scalability**: Ensure the framework can handle growing workloads
6. **Check community and documentation**: Active communities provide better support and resources

## Comparison with AI Agent Builders

It's important to distinguish between agentic frameworks and AI agent builders:

- **Agentic frameworks** provide the infrastructure and protocols for building complex, multi-agent systems
- **AI agent builders** are typically more user-friendly tools that simplify the creation of individual agents

For a comprehensive system like Manus AI, a combination of both may be necessary - using agentic frameworks for the underlying architecture while leveraging agent builders for specific components.

## Next Steps

To build a system similar to Manus AI, we should:

1. Analyze Manus AI's specific capabilities and architecture
2. Identify which framework(s) best align with those capabilities
3. Research implementation approaches, particularly no-code/low-code options
4. Develop a comprehensive guide with sample code examples
