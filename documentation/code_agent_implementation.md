# Synergos AI: Implementation Plan for Code Agent

## Overview

The Code Agent is a specialized component of Synergos AI, focused on programming, technical problem-solving, and code generation. This document outlines the implementation steps for creating the Code Agent in DataStax Langflow.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up Basic Canvas

1. Create a new flow in DataStax Langflow named "Synergos AI - Code Agent"
2. Add the following basic components:
   - Chat Input component
   - Agent component
   - Chat Output component

### 2. Configure AI Integration

1. Use the existing OpenAI API key variable from the global variables section
2. Connect the OpenAI API key to the Agent component
3. Select GPT-4 as the base model for advanced coding capabilities
4. Add option to switch to Claude for complex reasoning tasks

### 3. Implement Memory System

1. Add the "Astra DB Chat Memory" component
2. Configure the memory component with appropriate session settings
3. Connect the memory component to the Agent
4. Toggle the "External Memory" option in the Agent's Controls section

### 4. Define System Prompt

Create a custom system prompt for the Code Agent:

```
You are the Code Agent of Synergos AI, a specialized component focused on programming and technical problem-solving. Your role is to:

1. Write clean, efficient code in various programming languages
2. Debug and fix issues in existing code
3. Explain technical concepts in clear, accessible language
4. Optimize code for performance and readability
5. Provide implementation guidance for technical solutions

When working with code:
- Follow best practices and coding standards
- Write well-commented and documented code
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Optimize for readability and maintainability
- Provide explanations alongside code when helpful

Your goal is to help users solve technical problems, implement solutions, and understand programming concepts through high-quality code and clear explanations.
```

### 5. Add Coding Tools

1. Add the Code Executor tool for running code
2. Add the Syntax Highlighter tool for code formatting
3. Add the Code Analyzer tool for identifying issues
4. Add the Documentation Generator tool for code documentation
5. Connect all tools to the Agent component

### 6. Configure Communication Protocol

1. Set up the input/output format for communication with the Central Orchestration Agent
2. Implement logic for receiving coding tasks
3. Configure response formatting for consistent output

### 7. Test Coding Capabilities

1. Test the agent with simple coding requests
2. Verify that the agent can generate working code
3. Test the agent's debugging capabilities
4. Evaluate the quality and efficiency of generated code

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. Add support for more programming languages
2. Implement advanced code optimization features
3. Add integration with version control systems
4. Enhance debugging and error correction capabilities
5. Implement code security analysis features

## Technical Requirements

- DataStax Langflow account
- OpenAI API key
- Optional: Anthropic API key for Claude integration
- Astra DB for memory storage
- Code execution environment
- Programming language support libraries
