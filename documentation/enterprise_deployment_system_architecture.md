This document outlines the architectural design, including components, interactions, data flows, and integration points with existing systems.

## Architecture Principles

The architecture is guided by the following principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are designed with clear boundaries and interfaces
2. **Scalability**: The system can scale to handle deployments of varying sizes and complexity
3. **Reliability**: Deployments are reliable and include rollback mechanisms
4. **Security**: Security is embedded throughout the deployment process
5. **Automation**: Deployment processes are automated to minimize manual intervention

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment

Blue-green deployment involves maintaining two identical environments (blue and green) and switching traffic between them during deployment.

**Implementation**:
- Provision or update the inactive environment (green)
- Deploy new version to the green environment
- Run validation tests on the green environment
- Switch traffic from blue to green environment
- Monitor the green environment for issues
- If issues occur, switch traffic back to blue environment

### Canary Deployment

Canary deployment involves gradually routing traffic to the new version to minimize risk.

**Implementation**:
- Deploy new version alongside the current version
- Route a small percentage of traffic to the new version
- Monitor the new version for issues
- Gradually increase traffic to the new version
- If issues occur, route all traffic back to the current version
- Once validated, route all traffic to the new version

### Rolling Deployment

Rolling deployment involves updating instances of the application one at a time.

**Implementation**:
- Deploy new version to a subset of instances
- Wait for the instances to become healthy
- Continue deploying to remaining instances in batches
- If issues occur, stop the deployment and roll back affected instances
- Continue until all instances are updated
