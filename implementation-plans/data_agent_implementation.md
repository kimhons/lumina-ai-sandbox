# Synergos AI: Implementation Plan for Data Agent

## Overview

The Data Agent is a specialized component of Synergos AI, focused on data analysis, visualization, and insight generation. This document outlines the implementation steps for creating the Data Agent in DataStax Langflow.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up Basic Canvas

1. Create a new flow in DataStax Langflow named "Synergos AI - Data Agent"
2. Add the following basic components:
   - Chat Input component
   - Agent component
   - Chat Output component

### 2. Configure AI Integration

1. Use the existing OpenAI API key variable from the global variables section
2. Connect the OpenAI API key to the Agent component
3. Select GPT-4 as the base model for advanced analytical capabilities
4. Add option to switch to Gemini for data-intensive tasks

### 3. Implement Memory System

1. Add the "Astra DB Chat Memory" component
2. Configure the memory component with appropriate session settings
3. Connect the memory component to the Agent
4. Toggle the "External Memory" option in the Agent's Controls section

### 4. Define System Prompt

Create a custom system prompt for the Data Agent:

```
You are the Data Agent of Synergos AI, a specialized component focused on data analysis and visualization. Your role is to:

1. Process and analyze numerical and categorical data
2. Create meaningful visualizations to represent data
3. Identify patterns, trends, and insights in datasets
4. Perform statistical analysis and calculations
5. Generate data-driven reports and recommendations

When working with data:
- Ensure accurate calculations and analysis
- Choose appropriate visualization types for different data
- Explain insights in clear, non-technical language when needed
- Provide context and interpretation for data findings
- Maintain data integrity and acknowledge limitations

Your goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights that help users make informed decisions based on evidence and analysis.
```

### 5. Add Data Tools

1. Add the Calculator tool for mathematical operations
2. Add the Data Processor tool for handling datasets
3. Add the Visualization Generator tool for creating charts and graphs
4. Add the Statistical Analysis tool for advanced calculations
5. Connect all tools to the Agent component

### 6. Configure Communication Protocol

1. Set up the input/output format for communication with the Central Orchestration Agent
2. Implement logic for receiving data analysis tasks
3. Configure response formatting for consistent output

### 7. Test Data Capabilities

1. Test the agent with simple data analysis requests
2. Verify that the agent can perform calculations accurately
3. Test the agent's visualization capabilities
4. Evaluate the quality and clarity of insights generated

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. Add support for more data formats and sources
2. Implement advanced statistical methods
3. Enhance visualization capabilities with interactive elements
4. Add machine learning capabilities for predictive analysis
5. Implement data cleaning and preprocessing features

## Technical Requirements

- DataStax Langflow account
- OpenAI API key
- Optional: Google API key for Gemini integration
- Astra DB for memory storage
- Data processing and visualization tools
