# Synergos AI: Implementation Plan for Central Orchestration Agent

## Overview

The Central Orchestration Agent is the core component of Synergos AI, responsible for coordinating all specialized agents and managing user interactions. This document outlines the implementation steps for creating the Central Orchestration Agent in DataStax Langflow.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up Basic Canvas

1. Create a new flow in DataStax Langflow named "Synergos AI - Central Orchestration Agent"
2. Add the following basic components:
   - Chat Input component
   - Agent component
   - Chat Output component

### 2. Configure OpenAI Integration

1. Create an OpenAI API key variable in the global variables section
2. Connect the OpenAI API key to the Agent component
3. Select GPT-4 as the base model for optimal reasoning capabilities

### 3. Implement Memory System

1. Add the "Astra DB Chat Memory" component
2. Configure the memory component with appropriate session settings
3. Connect the memory component to the Agent
4. Toggle the "External Memory" option in the Agent's Controls section

### 4. Define System Prompt

Create a custom system prompt for the Central Orchestration Agent:

```
You are the Central Orchestration Agent of Synergos AI, a powerful multi-agent system. Your role is to:

1. Understand user requests and break them down into manageable tasks
2. Determine which specialized agent should handle each task:
   - Research Agent: For information gathering and synthesis
   - Content Agent: For writing and creative tasks
   - Data Agent: For analysis and visualization
   - Code Agent: For technical problem-solving

3. Coordinate between specialized agents to complete complex tasks
4. Aggregate results from specialized agents into coherent responses
5. Maintain conversation context and ensure a consistent user experience

When receiving a user request:
- Analyze the request to understand the user's needs
- Identify which specialized agent(s) would be best suited for the task
- For complex requests requiring multiple agents, break down the task into subtasks
- Provide clear, helpful responses that address the user's request

Always be helpful, accurate, and focused on delivering value to the user.
```

### 5. Add Basic Tools

1. Add the Calculator tool for basic mathematical operations
2. Add the Weather tool for retrieving weather information
3. Add the Search tool for basic web searches
4. Connect all tools to the Agent component

### 6. Configure Handoff Mechanisms

1. Create placeholder nodes for each specialized agent
2. Set up the communication protocol between the Central Orchestration Agent and specialized agents
3. Implement logic for task delegation and result aggregation

### 7. Test Basic Functionality

1. Test the agent with simple queries to ensure basic functionality
2. Verify that the memory system is working correctly
3. Test tool usage with appropriate queries
4. Simulate handoffs to specialized agents

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. Create and connect the Research Agent
2. Create and connect the Content Agent
3. Create and connect the Data Agent
4. Create and connect the Code Agent
5. Implement advanced tool integrations
6. Enhance the communication protocol between agents
7. Optimize performance and response quality

## Technical Requirements

- DataStax Langflow account
- OpenAI API key
- Astra DB for memory storage
- Additional API keys for specialized tools
