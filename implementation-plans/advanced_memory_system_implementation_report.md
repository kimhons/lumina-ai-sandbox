## System Architecture

The Advanced Memory System consists of four main components:

### 1. Neural Context Compression

This component uses advanced neural techniques to compress conversation context while preserving semantic meaning. Key features include:

- **Semantic Preservation**: Maintains critical information while reducing token usage
- **Adaptive Compression**: Adjusts compression ratio based on context importance
- **Key Information Extraction**: Identifies and preserves entities, facts, and user preferences
- **Contextual Summarization**: Creates concise summaries of lengthy conversations

- `/lumina-ai/microservices/memory-service/src/main/java/ai/lumina/memory/controller/CompressionController.java`

### 2. Hierarchical Memory Management

This component organizes memories into a hierarchical structure for efficient storage and retrieval. Key features include:

- **Topic-Based Organization**: Automatically categorizes memories into topics
- **Semantic Clustering**: Groups related memories based on semantic similarity
- **Importance Ranking**: Prioritizes memories based on relevance and importance
- **Memory Consolidation**: Merges related memories to reduce redundancy

- `/lumina-ai/microservices/memory-service/src/main/java/ai/lumina/memory/controller/TopicController.java`

### 3. Cross-Session Memory

This component enables persistent memory across user sessions, providing long-term knowledge retention. Key features include:

- **Persistent Storage**: Maintains memories across multiple sessions
- **Memory Lifecycle Management**: Handles creation, updating, and expiration of memories
- **User-Specific Memory Stores**: Maintains separate memory stores for each user
- **Importance-Based Retention**: Retains important memories longer than less important ones

- `/lumina-ai/microservices/memory-service/src/main/java/ai/lumina/memory/controller/PersistentMemoryController.java`

### 4. Memory Retrieval Optimization

This component provides sophisticated retrieval mechanisms to access the most relevant memories. Key features include:

- **Context-Aware Search**: Retrieves memories based on conversation context
- **Semantic Similarity**: Finds memories with similar meaning, not just keyword matches
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines multiple retrieval strategies for optimal results
- **Diversity-Aware Ranking**: Ensures diverse and comprehensive memory retrieval
