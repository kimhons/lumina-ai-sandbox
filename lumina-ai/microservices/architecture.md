# Lumina AI Microservices Architecture

This document outlines the service boundaries, interfaces, and communication patterns for the Lumina AI microservices architecture.

## 1. Service Boundaries

The Lumina AI system will be decomposed into the following microservices:

### 1.1 Core Services

- **Provider Service**: Manages AI provider integrations, capabilities, and selection
- **Memory Service**: Handles vector storage, context compression, and hierarchical memory
- **Security Service**: Manages authentication, authorization, and encryption
- **UI Service**: Provides visualization components and collaborative editing
- **Tool Service**: Manages tool integration and execution

### 1.2 Supporting Services

- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests
- **Discovery Service**: Manages service registration and discovery
- **Observability Service**: Handles logging, metrics, and tracing
- **Configuration Service**: Manages centralized configuration

## 2. Service Interfaces

### 2.1 Provider Service

**Responsibilities**:
- Register and discover AI providers
- Manage provider capabilities
- Select optimal provider for requests
- Stream completions from providers
- Track costs and usage

**Key APIs**:
- `/providers` - CRUD operations for providers
- `/providers/capabilities` - Manage provider capabilities
- `/providers/select` - Select provider based on capabilities
- `/providers/completion` - Generate completions
- `/providers/stream` - Stream completions
- `/providers/costs` - Track and report costs

### 2.2 Memory Service

**Responsibilities**:
- Store and retrieve vector embeddings
- Compress conversation context
- Manage hierarchical memory
- Extract topics and relationships

**Key APIs**:
- `/vectors` - CRUD operations for vector storage
- `/compression` - Compress and expand context
- `/memory` - Manage hierarchical memory
- `/topics` - Extract and manage topics

### 2.3 Security Service

**Responsibilities**:
- Authenticate users
- Authorize access to resources
- Manage encryption keys
- Audit security events

**Key APIs**:
- `/auth` - Authentication operations
- `/auth/mfa` - Multi-factor authentication
- `/auth/oauth` - OAuth integration
- `/rbac` - Role-based access control
- `/policies` - Policy management
- `/encryption` - Encryption operations

### 2.4 UI Service

**Responsibilities**:
- Provide visualization components
- Enable collaborative editing
- Manage UI state and synchronization

**Key APIs**:
- `/visualizations` - CRUD operations for visualizations
- `/documents` - Collaborative document operations
- `/realtime` - Real-time synchronization

### 2.5 Tool Service

**Responsibilities**:
- Register and discover tools
- Execute tools in sandbox
- Process tool results

**Key APIs**:
- `/tools` - CRUD operations for tools
- `/tools/execute` - Execute tools
- `/tools/results` - Process and retrieve results

## 3. Communication Patterns

### 3.1 Synchronous Communication

- REST APIs for request-response patterns
- gRPC for high-performance service-to-service communication
- GraphQL for flexible client queries

### 3.2 Asynchronous Communication

- Event-driven architecture using Kafka or RabbitMQ
- Event sourcing for critical data changes
- CQRS for separation of read and write operations

### 3.3 Event Types

- **Domain Events**: Represent business events (e.g., UserCreated, CompletionGenerated)
- **Integration Events**: Coordinate between services (e.g., ProviderAdded, MemoryUpdated)
- **Command Events**: Trigger actions (e.g., GenerateCompletion, StoreVector)

## 4. Data Ownership

Each service owns its domain data and is the source of truth for that data:

- **Provider Service**: Provider configurations, capabilities, and performance metrics
- **Memory Service**: Vector embeddings, memory nodes, and topic hierarchies
- **Security Service**: User accounts, roles, policies, and audit logs
- **UI Service**: Visualization configurations and document states
- **Tool Service**: Tool configurations and execution results

## 5. Resilience Patterns

- Circuit breakers for preventing cascading failures
- Retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Fallback mechanisms for degraded operation
- Bulkheads for isolating failures

## 6. Scalability Considerations

- Stateless services for horizontal scaling
- Database sharding for large datasets
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations

## 7. Service Discovery

- Service registry for dynamic discovery
- Health checks for service availability
- Load balancing for distributing requests
- Circuit breaking for handling failures

## 8. API Gateway

- Centralized entry point for all client requests
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request routing and load balancing
- Response caching
- API documentation

## 9. Observability

- Distributed tracing for request flows
- Centralized logging for troubleshooting
- Metrics collection for performance monitoring
- Alerting for proactive issue detection
- Dashboards for system visibility

## 10. Deployment Considerations

- Containerization with Docker
- Orchestration with Kubernetes
- CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
- Environment-specific configurations
- Canary deployments for risk mitigation
