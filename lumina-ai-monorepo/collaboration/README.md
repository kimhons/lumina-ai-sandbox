# Advanced Multi-Agent Collaboration System

## Overview

The Advanced Multi-Agent Collaboration System is a comprehensive framework that enables Lumina AI agents to work together effectively on complex tasks. This system provides mechanisms for team formation, context sharing, task negotiation, shared memory, and collaborative learning, allowing agents to combine their capabilities and knowledge to achieve better results than they could individually.

## Architecture

The system is composed of the following core components:

1. **Team Formation Service**: Dynamically creates teams of agents based on task requirements and agent capabilities.
2. **Collaborative Context Manager**: Manages shared context between agents to ensure consistent understanding.
3. **Task Negotiation Protocol**: Enables agents to negotiate task allocation and coordination.
4. **Shared Memory System**: Provides a unified memory system accessible to all team members.
5. **Collaborative Learning Module**: Allows agents to learn from each other's experiences and improve over time.
6. **Integration Layer**: Connects the collaboration system with existing Lumina AI components.

## Components

### Team Formation Service

The Team Formation Service matches agents with tasks based on their capabilities, specializations, and performance history. It supports multiple team formation strategies:

- **Optimal Coverage**: Maximizes coverage of required capabilities with minimal team size
- **Balanced Workload**: Distributes tasks evenly among team members
- **Minimal Size**: Creates the smallest team that can accomplish the task
- **Specialized Domain**: Prioritizes agents with relevant domain specializations

Key classes:
- `AgentCapabilityRegistry`: Maintains a registry of agent capabilities and specializations
- `TeamPerformanceMonitor`: Tracks team performance metrics
- `TeamFormationManager`: Manages the team formation process

### Collaborative Context Manager

The Collaborative Context Manager ensures that all agents in a team have access to the same context information. It supports different types of context:

- **User Input**: Information provided by users
- **System State**: Current state of the system
- **Task Definition**: Details about the task being performed
- **Agent Knowledge**: Knowledge contributed by agents
- **External Information**: Information from external sources

Key classes:
- `ContextItem`: Represents a piece of context information
- `CollaborativeContextService`: Manages context creation, retrieval, and sharing

### Task Negotiation Protocol

The Task Negotiation Protocol enables agents to negotiate task allocation, resolve conflicts, and coordinate their actions. It supports different types of negotiations:

- **Task Allocation**: Determining which agent performs which tasks
- **Resource Allocation**: Allocating shared resources among agents
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolving conflicts between agents
- **Consensus Building**: Reaching consensus on decisions

Key classes:
- `NegotiationService`: Manages the negotiation process
- `TaskDetails`: Represents details about a task for negotiation
- `Proposal`: Represents a proposal in a negotiation

### Shared Memory System

The Shared Memory System provides a unified memory system that all team members can access. It supports different types of memory:

- **Factual**: Factual information
- **Procedural**: Information about procedures and processes
- **Episodic**: Information about specific episodes or events
- **Semantic**: Conceptual information and relationships

Key classes:
- `SharedMemoryService`: Manages memory creation, retrieval, and sharing
- `MemoryAccessController`: Controls access to shared memory
- `MemorySynchronizer`: Ensures memory consistency across agents

### Collaborative Learning Module

The Collaborative Learning Module enables agents to learn from each other's experiences and improve over time. It supports:

- **Event Recording**: Recording learning events
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying patterns in events
- **Insight Generation**: Generating insights from patterns
- **Skill Model Sharing**: Sharing learned skills between agents

Key classes:
- `CollaborativeLearningService`: Manages the collaborative learning process
- `EventStore`: Stores learning events
- `PatternRecognizer`: Recognizes patterns in events
- `InsightGenerator`: Generates insights from patterns
- `SkillModelManager`: Manages skill models

### Integration Layer

The Integration Layer connects the collaboration system with existing Lumina AI components, particularly the provider system. It enables:

- **Provider Integration**: Integrating with Lumina AI providers
- **Team Creation**: Creating teams of providers for tasks
- **Context Sharing**: Sharing context between providers
- **Memory Access**: Accessing shared memory from providers

Key classes:
- `CollaborationManager`: Central manager for the collaboration system
- `CollaborativeAgent`: Agent that can participate in collaboration
- `CollaborativeProviderAdapter`: Adapter for integrating providers with the collaboration system

# Run all tests
unittest.main()
```

## Integration with Lumina AI

The Advanced Multi-Agent Collaboration System integrates with the existing Lumina AI system through the `CollaborativeProviderAdapter` class, which adapts Lumina AI providers to work with the collaboration system. This enables:

1. Using Lumina AI providers as collaborative agents
2. Forming teams of providers to handle complex tasks
3. Sharing context and memory between providers
4. Recording learning events from provider interactions

The system enhances Lumina AI's capabilities by enabling:

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Sharing knowledge and context between providers
- **Collaborative Learning**: Learning from the experiences of multiple providers
- **Dynamic Team Formation**: Forming teams of providers based on task requirements

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the system include:

1. **Advanced Team Formation Algorithms**: More sophisticated algorithms for team formation
2. **Improved Negotiation Protocols**: Enhanced protocols for task negotiation
3. **Federated Learning**: Distributed learning across multiple agents
4. **Human-Agent Collaboration**: Support for collaboration between human users and AI agents
