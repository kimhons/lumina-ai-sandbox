# Core Learning Components

This directory contains the core components of the Enhanced Learning System for Lumina AI.

## Key Components

- `model_registry.py`: Centralized registry for managing learning models
- `feature_engineering.py`: Pipeline for transforming raw data into features for learning
- `algorithm_factory.py`: Factory for creating and configuring learning algorithms
- `evaluation_framework.py`: Framework for evaluating model performance
- `model_storage.py`: System for storing and retrieving trained models

## Usage

These components form the foundation of the Enhanced Learning System and are used by other components to provide advanced learning capabilities.

See the main README.md in the learning directory for usage examples of these core components.
