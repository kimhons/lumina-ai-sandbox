- **Adaptive UI System**: For providing learning capabilities to the user interface

## Usage

```python
from learning.core.model_registry import ModelRegistry
from learning.core.feature_engineering import FeatureEngineeringPipeline
from learning.core.algorithm_factory import AlgorithmFactory
from learning.core.evaluation_framework import EvaluationFramework
from learning.integration.learning_system import EnhancedLearningSystem

# Initialize the learning system
learning_system = EnhancedLearningSystem(
    model_registry=ModelRegistry(),
    feature_engineering=FeatureEngineeringPipeline(),
    algorithm_factory=AlgorithmFactory(),
    evaluation_framework=EvaluationFramework()
)

# Train a model
model = learning_system.train_model(data, task_type="classification")

# Make predictions
predictions = learning_system.predict(model, new_data)

# Get explanations
explanations = learning_system.explain(model, data_point)

# Transfer knowledge between agents
learning_system.transfer_knowledge(knowledge_item, source_agent, target_agent)
```

## Collaborative Learning Example

```python
from learning.integration.collaborative_learning import CollaborativeLearningManager

# Initialize the collaborative learning manager
collab_learning = CollaborativeLearningManager(learning_system)

# Form a learning team
team = collab_learning.form_learning_team(learning_task, available_agents)

# Create a learning context
context = collab_learning.create_learning_context(team, learning_task)

# Distribute learning tasks
collab_learning.distribute_learning_task(team, context, learning_task)

# Coordinate federated learning
collab_learning.coordinate_federated_learning(team, context, learning_task, federation_config)
```

## Problem Solving Example

```python
from learning.integration.problem_solving import ProblemSolvingManager

# Initialize the problem solving manager
problem_solving = ProblemSolvingManager(learning_system)

# Analyze a problem
analysis = problem_solving.analyze_problem(problem_spec)

# Decompose a problem
decomposition = problem_solving.decompose_problem(problem_spec, analysis)

# Form a problem-solving team
team = problem_solving.form_problem_solving_team(problem_spec, decomposition, available_agents)

# Solve a problem
solution = problem_solving.solve_problem(problem_spec, available_agents)
```

## Testing

Run the tests using pytest:

```bash
